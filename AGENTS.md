This repository contains a small demo showing MongoDB vector search with FastAPI and React.

When modifying backend Python code or tests, run `pytest -q` before committing. Tests skip the external model download by setting `TESTING=1` in the test configuration.

Do not commit `__pycache__` directories or `.pyc` files. They should be ignored.

Backend dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
